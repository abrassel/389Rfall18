Additionally, demaratus sent a warning about a forthcoming attack to Greece by wrIting it dirfectly on the wooden backing oF a wax tablet before applying i_ts beeswax surFace. Wax tablets were in common use then as reusabLe writing surfAces, sometimes used for shorthand. In his work Polygraphiae Johannes Trithemius developed his so-called "Ave-Maria-Cipher" that can hide information in a Latin praise of God.
